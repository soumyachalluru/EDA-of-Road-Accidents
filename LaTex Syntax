\section{INTRODUCTION}
In California, traffic accidents represent a significant and complex challenge in the state's transportation environment. California has an extensive network of highways, interstates, and country roads, and is home to a wide variety of accidents, from minor fender benders to catastrophic collisions. Factors such as population density, diverse demographics, changing road conditions, and ever-evolving traffic patterns compound the problem. Understanding California crash dynamics is critical to implementing effective safety measures, reducing injuries and fatalities, and improving overall traffic safety.

The Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS) in California is a complete database for traffic collision information across the state. SWITRS collects data from multiple law enforcement agencies to offer a range of information surrounding road accidents in California. It provides informed decision-making for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, researchers, and the public through crash reports and statistical analyses. SWITRS, with its vast collection of data covering many years, is a crucial resource for studying, and tackling traffic safety issues on California's varied road systems.

California has reported over 250,000 total traffic collisions per year, involving different types of vehicles and road users. A majority of this is speeding-related. The state has seen thousands of fatalities resulting from road accidents each year, with the number changing but usually exceeding 3000 deaths annually. In 2023, from January to June alone, showed 2,061 deaths.

\section{SIGNIFICANCE TO THE REAL WORLD}

Accidents in California present various challenges concerning public safety, facilities management, and policy development. These accidents vary in nature and severity, surrounding collisions involving vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users. Factors such as traffic, weather, driver actions, and infrastructure deficiencies all play a crucial role in contributing to accidents.

Through the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS), the California Highway Patrol (CHP) keeps extensive records of traffic collisions, offering useful information for analysis and prevention. The frequency, spread, and causes of accidents throughout the state and road types can be learned through analysis of this data. Hotspots for accidents frequently include highways, urban crossroads, and regions with significant pedestrian traffic. 

Campaigns for public awareness that promote cautious driving, eliminate distractions, and boost the safety of bicyclists and pedestrians are essential to minimizing accidents. Law enforcement organizations play a major role in enforcing traffic regulations, preventing careless driving, and minimizing the prevalence of driving while inebriated and unfocused.

Furthermore, the goal of continuing investment in transportation infrastructure is to mitigate accident risks and enhance overall road safety. Examples of these investments include redesigning roads, modernizing intersections, and putting cutting-edge safety systems into place. 

In general, tackling the problem of accidents in California demands a committed and data-driven strategy that makes use of accident data insights to determine focused actions and laws aimed to make roads safer for all users.

\section{LITERATURE SURVEY}
There is much helpful research in data analysis, accident prediction, and prevention. One of the journal reviews from “The New York Times” reveals a significant focus on leveraging various datasets and analytical tools to delve into accident patterns, contributing factors, and mitigation strategies. Researchers
have explored the utilization of diverse datasets and real-time national databases to analyze accident rates,
severity, and locations. One notable statement in most research is that analyzing accidents is vital in training
self-driving vehicles. By studying accident data, we can develop algorithms and models that enable
autonomous vehicles to navigate California’s roads better. The effectiveness of past safety interventions and
the potential of emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles have been subjects of investigation, paving
the way for a safer transportation future. This research reflects a concerted effort to enhance traffic safety in
California, leveraging accident analysis to train and improve the capabilities of self-driving vehicles and
striving to reduce accidents and their impact on residents.

\section{ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM}
The relationships between entity sets in a database are shown in an entity-relationship diagram (ERD). An individual data unit is an entity in this sense. An "entity package" is a collection of similar entities. These entities' qualities are specified by their attributes. We can see from the ERD that the collisions table is relationships with parties and victims tables along with a foreign key for the same.

\end{figure}

\section{TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES}
\begin{itemize}
\item In Redshift, the default datatype for time was timestamp but the requirement was to have time without timezone. So we had to default setting of the Redshift datatype. 
\item While making connections from Glue to Redshift, we faced issues with endpoints, when making connections from S3 to AWS Glue to Redshift. We reconfigured the entire Glue pipeline from scratch. 
\item Learning to use AWS was time consuming as its terminologies were difficult to understand. 
\end{itemize}

\section{ DATA VISUALIZATION}
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data or information.Visualization can be in the form of charts, maps or graphs. Highly complex qualitative and quantitative data can be effectively represented visually thus making it easier to process and analyze. 
In our project, we have used Redshift charts and MongoDB charts for visualization.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/s6.jpeg}
    \caption{Weather vs Collision Severity}
     \label{fig:enter-labe}
\end{figure}

\section{ANALYSIS}
\begin{itemize}
\item It appears clear weather is predominant, suggesting that factors other than weather play a significant role in collision severity.
\item Peaking in the mid to late afternoon especially at 5-6pm, there is a higher risk of accidents during these hours, which could correlate with office to home return traffic.
\item Over half of the fatal accidents occurred while vehicles were proceeding straight. The next significant movements are making a left turn and running off the road, highlighting potential areas for targeted safety interventions.
\item Impact of cell phone usage like using maps (on cell phone) has been associated with a substantial number of accidents, including other usages like searching or chatting. \item This emphasizes the importance of hands-free operation and the potential dangers of distractions while navigating.

\end{itemize} 

\section{AWS IMPLEMENTATION}
In AWS, we created a VPC endpoint first, then created Redshift clusters and S3 bucket. We used Glue to integrate a local host PostgreSQL to AWS RDS. Then we used Crawler to load the data of all three tables from the relational database into S3 bucket and then into Redshift.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}


\section{LESSONS LEARNED}
\begin{itemize}
\item We learned how to use AWS Solution Stack to build end-to-end Data Engineering/ Data Warehousing Solutions.
\item We uploaded the data to the PostgreSQL database from csv files. Before uploading data, we made sure to clean the files according to the PostgreSQL datatype format.
\item Data cleaning with an ETL tool like AWS Glue and Excel is much easier than python pandas.
\end{itemize}
